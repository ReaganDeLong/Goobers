    <li>I adopted him in the winter of 2017, along with Peso. Both are FIV+</li><br>
    <li>He is not named after the tech company! He was brought in as a group and they were all named fruits, i.e. 'Melon', 'Berry', 'Apple', etc.</li><br>
    <li>Apple developed a bad case of stomatitis (oral disease) and he needed to have all of his teeth extracted. Yes, he still eats hard food!</li><br>
    <li>A hilarious bit of confusion: When I adopted Apple, I was told that Apple was a girl. When Apple was being examined and prepped for surgery to remove her teeth, the veterinarean surgeon informed me that She was, in fact, a He. Apple is a boy! Whoops!</li><br>
    <li>Apple does not play very much but he thoroughly enjoys being brushed (even though thereâ€™s not much fur to brush).</li><br>
    <li>Apple is the least intelligent cat in our home (out of 5 total), but he is easily the sweetest and most loving. Perhaps ignorance really is bliss.</li>
